## Overview

Custom PCB designs for the Alia humanoid control system. Electronics release follows the same phased open-source approach as mechanical components.

## Boards

### Joint Controller Board (Dual RP2040/RP2350)

**Purpose:** Main control board for joint actuation and sensor management

**Features:**
- Dual Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040 or RP2350) slots
  - Core 0: PID control loops, motor drive, safety limits
  - Core 1: Serial communication, trajectory interpolation, logging
- MT6835 magnetic encoder interface (SPI)
- LKM motor driver integration (CAN/PWM)
- Power distribution and regulation
- Tendon tension sensor inputs
- Compact form factor for human-scale integration

**Status:** ðŸ”„ PCB design finalized, Gerber files coming soon

**What will be released:**
- âœ… Schematic (PDF)
- âœ… Gerber files (manufacturing-ready)
- âœ… BOM with part numbers
- âœ… Assembly documentation
- ðŸ“… KiCad source files (Phase 2, 2026+)

## Release Timeline

- **Q1 2026:** Schematic, Gerber, BOM release
- **Q2 2026:** KiCad source files (Phase 2 transition)
- **2026+:** Additional boards (power distribution, encoder breakout)

## Design Philosophy

Like the mechanical design, electronics are constrained by human-scale requirements:
- Compact PCB footprint for tight integration
- Efficient power routing (minimize heat in enclosed spaces)
- Robust connectors for tendon-driven vibration
- Modularity for iterative development

---

## Contributing

Electronics contributions follow the same DCO guidelines as software and mechanical (see root `CONTRIBUTING.md`). 

**Once source files are released:**
1. KiCad 7.0+ required
2. Follow IPC-2221 design rules
3. Include schematic + layout changes in same commit
4. Run DRC before submitting PR
