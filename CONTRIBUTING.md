# Contributing to Alia

Thanks for your interest in contributing! 

## Why Contribute to Alia?

Alia is exploring humanoid mechanics with **radical transparency**: we document what works ‚úÖ and what doesn't ‚ö†Ô∏è, inside real human constraints.

**What makes this project different:**
- **Honesty over hype** ‚Äî We share failures and iterations, not just successes
- **Real constraints** ‚Äî Building inside human proportions forces innovative solutions
- **Progressive open source** ‚Äî Phased licensing roadmap toward full collaboration
- **Engineering depth** ‚Äî Tendon-driven actuation, biomechanics validation, hardware iteration

Phase 0 is early-stage, but we're building a foundation for genuine collaboration. If you value:
- Transparent engineering process
- Bio-inspired robotics design
- Open hardware with clear governance
- Community-driven development

...then Alia might be a project worth your time.

## Ground Rules

- Use English for code comments, documentation, and issues
- No CAD / STL uploads yet (Phase 0 ‚Äî releasing soon with clear licensing)
- Keep commits small and logically scoped
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions

---

## DCO Sign-off (Required)

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add ankle calibration script"
```

This asserts you have the right to contribute under the project license ([Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)).

**Why DCO?** It ensures clean licensing and protects both you and the project. It's a simple line added automatically with `-s` flag.

---

## Branches

- **`main`** (protected) ‚Äî Stable code, fast-forward or squash via PR only
- **`feature/<short-topic>`** ‚Äî For proposed changes

Example branch names:
- `feature/pid-tuning-script`
- `feature/update-ankle-docs`
- `fix/serial-timeout-bug`

---

## Opening a Pull Request

1. **Create an issue first** (if non-trivial change)
   - Describe the problem or improvement
   - Reference related decisions (if known)
   - Wait for feedback before major work

2. **Fork and branch**
   - Fork the repo
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-topic`

3. **Make changes**
   - Follow style guidelines (see below)
   - Include tests if applicable
   - Update docs if behavior changes

4. **Sign your commits**
   - Always use `git commit -s`
   - Check: `git log -1` should show `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>`

5. **Open PR**
   - Reference issue: "Closes #123" or "Related to #456"
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Request review

## Style Guidelines

### Directory Naming
- Use `lowercase-kebab` for directories
- Examples: `ankle-controller`, `pid-tuning`, `hardware-tests`

### Commit Messages
Use **conventional commit** prefixes:

- `feat:` ‚Äî New feature
- `fix:` ‚Äî Bug fix
- `docs:` ‚Äî Documentation only
- `refactor:` ‚Äî Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `test:` ‚Äî Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` ‚Äî Maintenance (dependencies, build, etc.)

Examples:
```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add automatic tendon calibration routine"
git commit -s -m "fix: resolve serial timeout in measurement mode"
git commit -s -m "docs: clarify PID tuning procedure in README"
```

### Code Style
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8, use type hints where reasonable
- **C++:** Follow existing firmware style (see `software/firmware/` examples)
- **Markdown:** Keep public docs brief and scannable (see Documentation section below)

---

## Documentation Standards

**Public-facing docs** (README, guides, API references) must be:

- ‚úÖ **Brief and clear** ‚Äî Prioritize understanding over completeness
- ‚úÖ **Essential information only** ‚Äî Remove unnecessary examples or verbosity
- ‚úÖ **Scannable** ‚Äî Use bullet points, tables, and headings
- ‚úÖ **Honest** ‚Äî Include limitations and known issues

**This is critical.** Over-documentation is as bad as under-documentation. Ask: "Does this help someone get started or solve a problem?"

---

## Testing

Before opening a PR:

- ‚úÖ Code compiles (firmware) or runs without errors (Python)
- ‚úÖ No linter errors (`ruff` for Python, `cppcheck` for C++)
- ‚úÖ Manual testing on hardware (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated (if behavior changed)

We don't have automated tests yet (Phase 0), but manual validation is expected.

## What NOT to Contribute (Yet)

- ‚ùå **CAD files / STL modifications** ‚Äî Phase 0 hardware not yet released
- ‚ùå **Large binary assets** ‚Äî Use external hosting and link instead
- ‚ùå **Breaking API changes** ‚Äî Discuss in issue first
- ‚ùå **Unrelated features** ‚Äî Stay focused on Phase 0 scope

---

## License Acknowledgement

By contributing you agree:

- **Code contributions:** Licensed under MIT (same as project software)
- **Hardware contributions:** Subject to phased licensing roadmap (see `hardware/LICENSE.md`)
  - Your contributions remain attributed
  - You agree to licensing transitions as hardware matures
  - No retroactive license changes on code (MIT stays MIT)

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and patient. We're building in public, which means:

- ‚úÖ Critique ideas, not people
- ‚úÖ Assume good intent
- ‚úÖ Focus on engineering substance
- ‚ùå No marketing hype or overpromises
- ‚ùå No unconstructive negativity

We document failures and limitations transparently ‚Äî that's a feature, not weakness.
