# Contributing (Phase 0)

Thanks for your interest. During Phase 0 we keep the surface minimal.

## Ground Rules
- Use English for code comments, Italian or English for issues.
- No CAD / STL uploads yet.
- Keep commits small and logically scoped.

## DCO Sign-off
All commits must include a Signed-off-by line:
```
git commit -s -m "feat: something"
```
This asserts you have the right to contribute under the project license.

## Branches
- main (protected) â€” fast-forward or squash via PR only.
- feature/<short-topic> for proposed changes.

## Opening a PR
1. Create issue (if non-trivial)
2. Reference decision ID if relevant
3. Ensure `Signed-off-by:` appears (check `git log -1`)

## Style
- Use lowercase-kebab for directories
- Conventional commit prefixes (chore, feat, fix, docs, refactor, test)

## License Acknowledgement
By contributing you license your code under MIT and agree future mechanical licensing transitions do not retroactively affect your code contributions.
