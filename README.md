# Alia Humanoid Core (Phase 0)

Minimal public scaffold.  
Phase 0 focus: bootstrap governance, licensing clarity, and contribution discipline (D001).

## Scope (Phase 0)
- Software scaffolding only.
- No CAD / STL files released yet.
- Preparing governance & contributor standards.

## Licensing
Software: MIT (see LICENSE).  
Mechanical design assets: NOT YET RELEASED (planned staged release; initial STL(s) will ship under CC BY-NC-ND, later transition roadmap documented in governance).

## Public Updates
See `PUBLIC_UPDATES.md` for periodic transparent project notes (initially empty stub).

## Contributing
External code contributions require:
1. Sign-off (`git commit -s`)
2. No large binary assets in this phase
3. Follow guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Roadmap Snapshot
Phase 0 → repo + governance bootstrap  
Phase 1 → first mechanical asset release (CC BY-NC-ND → evaluation)  
Phase 2 → broaden licensing / potential CC BY-SA for CAD  
Phase 3 → open-core model refinements

## DCO
Developer Certificate of Origin enforced via DCO bot. Every commit must have a Signed-off-by line.

Initial scaffold created under decision D001 (see internal decision log).
